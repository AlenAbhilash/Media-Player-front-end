What is Lifting State Up?

Lifting state up is a pattern in React where you 
move state to the closest common ancestor of components 
that need to share or modify that state. Instead of 
maintaining duplicate state in multiple components,
you keep the state in a single parent component and 
pass it down to child components via props. When a 
child component needs to modify that state, it does
so by calling a function provided by the parent 
component, which updates the state.
